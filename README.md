## BOM 
* 2x 4010 blower fans 
* 1x 2510 axial fan 
* various m3 hardware 
* BMG extruder kit , or G2 extruder kit (HGX variant is planned)
* Dragon Compatible hotend, Revo Voron, Rapido, TZV6 with or without v6 nozzle
* NOTE: if using a TZV6 hotend with the stock nozzle (small bambu style nozzle) you need to use the dragon hotend mount


when mounting the fans, the front cover needs to be removed prior to screwing it down with 2 m2x6
