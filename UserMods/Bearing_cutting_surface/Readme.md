# Bearing cutting surface
<p align="center"><img width="300" src="assets/bearing_cutting_surface.png"></p>

This mod replaces the main body to provide a pocket for a small bearing which will act as the shear surface for leafcutter.

To avoid tiny pieces of PTFE, the filament path is a printed 2mm diameter.

Variants for MR63ZZ bearings (6mm outer diameter, 2.5mm depth) and 683 bearings (7mm outer diameter, 3mm depth) are provided.

## Instructions
A fitment test is provided. Please print it oriented as presented to ensure it's printed in the same orientation as the full part.

Pick your desired logo, extruder mounting pattern and length for your bearing type. Print as provided, same as the original.
Ream out the filament path with a 2mm drill bit, and press the bearing into place. Glue should not be necessary.

## Caveat
The 683 bearing versions are untested, and the bearing pocket might collide with the "neck screw" heat set insert.
